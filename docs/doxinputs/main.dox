@section fatigue_intro Introduction

Hello there ! Welcome in the documentation of the *fatigue* testing framework. fatigue stands for Framework for Advanced Testing Inducing a Grotesque User Experience. Grotesque, because unlike most testing frameworks, it sacrifices a bit of simplicity to for flexibility and extensibility, having user handle test registration manually. Therefore, you probably want to use it only for what it is used for : extensive unit and integration testing, including component specification testing. 

In summary, fatigue is a testing framework not framing too much.

@section main_contents In this documentation

\ref tutorial "Tutorial" is an introduction on how to use fatigue. If you are new, you should probably start reading here.

\ref user_api "User Api" documents user-targetted classes. This is complementary to tutorial.

\ref checks "Checks" documents checks availables in the framework. 

\ref architecture "Architecture" is an overview of how fatigue is structured, as well as some explanations of its non-trivial mechanisms. It is meant for people wanting to customize fatigue for their needs, but it can also interesting to look at it if you are a basic user.

Namespaces, classes and files dropdowns gives you access to api and internal documentations of fatigue sources. Please bear in mind that internal documentation is *complementary* with the code, and thus you may have to observe the code a bit to fully understand fatigue's internals.

\ref development "Development" provides guidelines regarding development practices of the project, and is aimed to people wanting to contribute to fatigue.
