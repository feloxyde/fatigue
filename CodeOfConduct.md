# Code of conduct

fatigue is a free an opensource library, and contributing to the project will likely lead you
to interact with other sentient beings, either directly, as oral or chat communication, or indirectly, 
through comments or even code sharing. You are highly encouraged to be respectful to everyone during 
such interactions, would they be part of the community or not.

So, please read further the present code and make as much efforts as you can to conform to it while interacting with, within and from the fatigue community. 

## Empathy, patience and tolerance

We all have different backgrounds. The general rule of conduct is to keep that in mind when interacting with each other, and that equivalent effort has to be made by both parties 
to understand each other, adapt, and communicate in a peaceful and pleasant way. This also implies respecting the other party, whatever happens.

### Things I should not have to state

Any behavior that is meant to cause harm to others is prohibed. This includes, but is not limited to, discrimination, harassment, oppression and insult, of any kind. It goes against the idea of *making an effort to understand each other and communicate in a peaceful and pleasant way*, especially the *pleasant* part. 

Also, don't be hypocritical regarding quantification of *effort* you or others have to make to do something. 
As an example, calling a trans person by the pronoun the person want to be called by, likely isn't that much of a big effort, while not doing so may make the person extremely uncomfortable. 
As another example, the effort that a dyslexic person has to make in order to write according to traditional orthographic rules is much, much bigger than the effort non-dyslexic people have to make to read non traditional rules compliant writing.

Such hypocrisy includes trolling as well. 

## Constructive criticism

Criticism is an important aspect of creation and software development process. Software development and creation are fields where there is not only one good way to do things.
Criticism shall therefore be *constructive*, and thus : 

- Be backed by **verifiable** evidence and/or reasonning, which can be criticized as well. 
- Be respectful and on a positive tone, or at least neutral.
- Offer solutions or ideas as much as possible.
- Be moderate and prudent, not being presented as the truth but as an hypothesis, and present its limits as much as possible.
- Be focused on, and restricted to, its subject. (in case this isn't clear, don't make personal attacks).

Constructive criticism shall be accepted without any resentment, and is always open to discussion. Confront point of views and thoughts, and try to find a consensus.

## Keep unrelated stuff away

Things not related to fatigue and its develompment, as religion, politics or other out-of-subject opinions and discussions, shall be kept away from fatigue. Exception can arise in case of explicite mention, for example a chatroom with `unrelated stuff` title.

## Acknowledge and credit

With the right of sharing comes the duty of acknowledgement.
Free and open source software doesn't mean *no author*, that's even the opposite. FOSS authors and contributors are most of the time volunteers doing this on their free time and do not get paid for that. However, they may take a form of pride in their contributions, and feel betrayed if they happen to find someone is taking credit for the code they wrote. It is an elementary duty to credit people having participated to contributions, either internal or external to the project.

This includes, but is not limited to : 

- When implementing or offering a non-trivial solution that has not been conceived by yourself.
- When taking non-trivial code from external source as stackoverflow.
- When using other tools as inspiration.

Acknowledgement can take various forms, as for example, a comment in code or a line in the documentation body of a function.

## Enforcement

If someone poses a problem to you, follow these steps : 
- First, if possible, try to let the person know that you are uncomfortable. 
- Second, if nothing goes better, reach out a moderator/maintainer, depending on the context.

The usual approach a modetator will take is to first try to mediate between the two parties to help them find a consensus and/or encourage the offending party to 
repair the mistake/offend and apologize. 
In case the offending party would not take not of advices and demands formulated by the moderator, sanctions can be taken, as temporary or permanent ban.
Note that in case of serious misconduct, or false/trolling report, the mediation step may be skept straight to sanction.

## Modifications of the Code Of Conduct

This code of conduct may be subject to changes in the future, especially through more explicit rules regarding behavior toward others. You therefore are encouraged to regularly inform yourself of changes in the code of conduct.
