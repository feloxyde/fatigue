# Contributing to fatigue

There are several ways in which you can contribute to fatigue. 

- Communicate : talk about fatigue to your friends and colleagues.
- Feedbacks : comment on feedback-tagged issues to give your opinion about some points, or ideas. You can also simply star the project, which is motivating.
- Devops : help setting up the project by either providing tools or setting them up, especially for code quality.
- Testing : write more tests to enhance reliability of the project
- Development : add features, fix bugs or review code.
- Documenting : help others using this by documenting the project and reviewing current documentation.

Please read **to be added later** for more informations.
